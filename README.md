# Charts Demo

This is a basic demonstration of charting with [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/) and [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki). chart.js is typically considered a simple and easy to use charting library that lacks some of the more advanced features. D3, on the other hand, is not technically a charting library, but a data driven tool for manipulated documents (Data Driven Documents === D3). That said, it is commonly used for charting and data visualization. It is far more powerful and flexible, but with that comes a fairly steep learning curve.
